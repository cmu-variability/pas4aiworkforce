## Program Details

### AI Course

Our remote AI course will run 10 weeks from March 30, 2026 until June 5, 2026.
The Zoom part of the course will run two days a week (TBD) from 1:00pm-2:30pm ET.

We aim to start at the same time as the typical college Spring quarter. If you like, 
        we can help you obtain independent study credit from a professor at your college. 
        [Email us](mailto:pas4aiworkforce@gmail.com) to learn how!
        
You will be taught a curriculum in AI which includes Python Pandas, using large-language models (LLMs) for code generation, 
        data analysis and visualization, prompt engineering, transformer models, integrating LLMs into Python,
        retrieval-augmented generation, bias, ethics, and hallucinations in AI, and building AI-driven applications.

You will do your AI and LLM work using Google CoLab notebooks.

You will be taught communication and teamwork skills to prepare you to work as part 
        of a professional AI/data science/software team. These skills include team 
        introductions, negotiating communication preferences, communicating across 
        differences, creating a team contract, brainstorming, reading and writing 
        project specifications, standup meetings, writing and presenting status 
        reports, problem solving, interpersonal collaboration, pair programming, 
        mobbing, giving and receiving feedback, and presenting work orally and in 
        written form.

You will also be taught social-emotional skills to enable you to practice the 
        communication and teamwork skills you learn even while experiencing low self-confidence, 
        imposter syndrome, or anxiety. These include self-awareness, self-management, 
        social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making skills. 

You will learn to work in trios and in teams of 5-6 students and will 
        develop a substantial AI project as part of your coursework.

For each week you meaningfully participate in the course, 
        you will earn a stipend of $176.

### Internship

If you successfully complete our AI course, you will be matched with an organization
    that will offer you a remote or in-person, full-time, summer internship lasting 12 weeks. 
    The internship will involve doing AI work for the organization. 
    You will be hired by the organization as an employee.

We will do our best to find you an internship that matches your interests and skills.
   You (and the organization) will have the opportunity to accept or reject the internship match that we select for you.
   If either you or the organization reject the match, we will attempt to find another internship for you. If we cannot, 
   you may return to our program in a future offering for an opportunity to do your internship then.</p>

Internships may start immediately after the AI class finishes, on Monday June 8, 2026. Internships should run 12 weeks.

For each week that you meaningfully participate in your internship, you will earn a $880 stipend. This stipend is not a salary. The company you work for is the one hiring you, not the PAS4AI Workforce project.
