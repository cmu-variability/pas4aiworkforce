# About the Course
The Preparing Autistic Students for the AI Workforce (PAS4AI) course aims to design and deliver accessible, team-based learning experiences that prepare autistic community college students for AI-integrated careers. Our interdisciplinary curriculum combines AI fundamentals, Responsible AI practices, and leadership skills through experiential learning. Students work in small, instructor-led project teams to develop real-world AI applications while building communication confidence, technical fluency, and psychological safety in teamwork.
In Spring 2026, the course will bring together 9 students for collaborative AI projects co-instructored by graduate and postdoctoral researchers. Each instructor supports one student team, guiding both their technical development and professional growth.

# Role Overview
AI Project Instructors are educators, researchers, and/or practitioners who guide undergraduate teams of 3-5 students in applied AI projects. Our research team has created a 10-week curriculum along with instructional guidance and teaching materials for instructors to use to teach the course. Students will complete and remix a series of AI projects that reflect the goals and beliefs about AI development, social relationships, and emotional wellbeing and personal identities. Instructors provide:
- Technical guidance in areas such as Python programming, LLM integration, API-based project development, prompt engineering, model evaluation, and ethical AI analysis.
- Coaching on teamwork, communication, and inclusive collaboration practices.
- Coaching on self-reflection and goal-setting
- Support for integrating Responsible AI and ethical reflection into project decisions.
- Feedback on code, research design, and final presentations.


Instructors are encouraged to bring their own research and professional interests into the course to co-create authentic, mutually beneficial learning experiences.

# Benefits for Instructors
- Gain hands-on experience teaching and instructing diverse student teams on real AI projects.
- Build a portfolio of teaching, codesign, and instructoring artifacts relevant to academia and industry.
- Collaborate within an interdisciplinary community of practice focused on Responsible AI, education, and accessibility.
- Contribute to inclusive education and workforce pathways for underrepresented learners in computing.
- Receive structured guidance on teaching, social-emotional learning, mentoring, and inclusive instruction through the PAS4AI instructor orientation.
- Stipend of $7,000 for teaching the course.


# Required Qualifications
- Enrollment in or completion of a graduate degree (Master’s or Ph.D.) in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human–Computer Interaction, Learning Sciences, or a related field.
- Demonstrated experience teaching, instructoring, or facilitating technical learning (e.g., course instruction, coding clubs, lab instructoring, TA roles).
- Strong interpersonal communication and commitment to inclusive, supportive pedagogy.
- Ability to articulate technical concepts clearly and guide student inquiry rather than simply provide answers.

# Preferred Qualifications
- Prior teaching experience at the high school, college, or community level, or experience instructing neurodiverse learners.
- Familiarity with Responsible AI, Human-AI Interaction, or Computing Education research.
- Interest in integrating personal or lab research into project-based instruction.
- Awareness of social-emotional learning and the role of psychological safety in team performance.
- Commitment to collaborative teaching and iterative improvement through feedback and reflection.
- Experience interacting with autistic or neurodivergent individuals.
  
**Training and Expectations**
Instructors will participate in a two-part orientation and ongoing community meetings designed to prepare them for inclusive, empathetic instruction. Training emphasizes:
- Identifying tacit prerequisite knowledge and preparing to teach foundational concepts as needed.
- Reframing knowledge gaps into opportunities for growth.
- Supporting interdependence and reflective teamwork in AI learning environments.


# To Apply
📩  Please submit the following materials to Andrew Begel (abegel@andrew.cmu.edu) and Ren Butler (ddbutler@andrew.cmu.edu):

- A short statement (≤300 words) describing your motivation for instructing and how your research or teaching interests align with PAS4AI and SAFER-AI.
- A brief CV or résumé highlighting teaching and/or AI or computing education research experience.
- (Optional) A link to a project, publication, or resource that reflects your teaching or technical work.

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until positions are filled.
