We can ameliorate the shortage by reaching out to untapped populations, such as autistic STEM community      college students. Autistic people often demonstrate a strong affinity for STEM; however, they suffer      from an 80% unemployment rate due to social stigma and discrimination. </p> <p>The goal of our project is to address the employment gap by establishing innovative pathways for     autistic students to specialize in AI careers. This proposal will develop innovative pedagogical      materials and scalable tools to teach AI technical skills through a \"learning-by-doing\" experience,      teach crucial team collaboration and communication skills through AI-focused project-based learning,      and facilitate autistic community college students to obtain AI-focused summer internships and      increase their access to AI careers. By providing internships for autistic students, this project      will debunk the harmful stereotypes and change the exclusionary norms that impact their employment.</p> <p>We use a strengths-based approach to provide strategies and supports that allow individuals with      autism to engage confidently, competently, and with a positive sense of self when navigating      the complex and challenging social environment of the workplace. Our pedagogical innovations      include the human factors and user interface design to support AI subject-matter experts, mentors,      and teachers learning to teach autistic students. Special education experts in autism who      specialize in teaching communication, social, and teaming skills support our mentors      in their day-to-day learning experiences. We employ online training to reach more autistic      students and also make our online course materials available to community college teachers      to offer this course at their own schools. Our program is scalable and self-sustaining      through the training of mentors to support autistic people and have those mentors work with      the interns in our program.</p>"},{"location":"#people","title":"People","text":""},{"location":"#principal-investigators","title":"Principal Investigators                          Andrew Begel                                                Somayeh Asadi                                                Richard Kubina, Jr.","text":"Associate Professor              Carnegie Mellon University                  Professor              University of Virginia                  Professor of Education              Penn State University"},{"location":"#senior-personnel","title":"Senior Personnel                          Taniya Mishra","text":"Founder and CEO              SureStart, LLC"},{"location":"#external-evaluator","title":"External Evaluator                          D.
